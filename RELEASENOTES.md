## Release Notes ##

###Version 1.0.2###

Version 1.0.2 fixed lots of crashing and also made it work... better.

* Colors are now stronger to better indicate newer changes
* Only the last 25 changes are "heat mapped". Changes older than this are all the most faded color
* Made the bars thinner to be more in line with standard indicator lines (green and yellow VS default ones)
* Re-worked the way it saves lines to prevent holidng objects from the live text editor that expire
* Paste and deletes now highlight lines properly
* Paste and delete lines will adjust indicators lower in the document (so they stay with the correct line).
